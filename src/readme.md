# Simple MemoryGame
## Objective
My objective on this project is to create a simple memory game in order
to familiarize myself with the JavaScript language and DOM. Before this
project I had no experience in web development. So during this project I
will allow myself to play around with Javascript and DOM.

## What most the program do
Display given amount of pairs of cards.

Count and display  the amount of guesses the user has done.

Count the users points.



# Learning Diary

## 9.1.2025
For couple of days I have been now just playing around. I have learned the
basics of how to manipulate DOM objects. Also I have learned some of the 
basics of JavaScript.

So far It seems to me that I am mostly just accumulating questions. But 
from now on I will do this project and update this learning diary after each session.
