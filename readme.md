# Simple MemoryGame
## Objective
My objective on this project is to create a simple memory game in order
to familiarize myself with the JavaScript language and DOM. Before this
project I had no experience in web development. So during this project I
will allow myself to play around with Javascript and DOM.

## What should the program do
Display given amount of pairs of cards.

Count and display  the amount of guesses the user has done.

Count the users points.

Keep track of the time it took for the user to complete the game.



# Learning Diary

## 9.1.2025
For couple of days I have been now just playing around. I have learned the
basics of how to manipulate DOM objects. Also I have learned some of the 
basics of JavaScript.

Also I realized that although I have done the JYU Web publishing course, I seem to have forgotten mostly 
everything I have previously learned about HTML and CSS. However the good part seems to be that I am now much
more fluent at reading the documentation from the MDN Web docs which makes the refreshing of my
memory faster.

So far It seems to me that I am mostly just accumulating questions. But 
from now on I will do this project and update this learning diary after each session.

## 10.1.2025
Goal for today is to make cards in memory game appear in the game board in random order. 
I started this already little bit yesterday.

Would have been nice if JS had some sort of inbuilt method for shuffling arrays...Now it seems I have 
created some sort of infinite loop in my own shuffling algorithm :D

Tomorrow I have to learn how to do unit testing in JS. Debugging without any unit tests is such a pain in the butt...also
I have to learn how to properly debug these web apps in the browser or in the IDE.

Little bit frustrating day today.
